Smart E-commerce Product Recommender ðŸ›’This project is a Python-based e-commerce recommendation engine. It demonstrates two popular recommendation techniques: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.FeaturesContent-Based Filtering: Recommends products similar to a selected product based on its name, description, and category. This is implemented in the "You Might Also Like" feature.Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products to a user based on the preferences of other users with similar tastes. This is used for the "Recommended For You" feature.Command-Line Interface: A simple and interactive CLI to simulate browsing an e-commerce website.Tech StackPython: The core programming language.Pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling the product and ratings datasets.Scikit-learn: Used to calculate product similarity using TfidfVectorizer and linear_kernel (for cosine similarity).How It WorksContent-Based FilteringText Combination: The text from the name, description, and category fields for each product is combined into a single string.TF-IDF Vectorization: The combined text is converted into a numerical representation using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). This helps in understanding the importance of words in the product descriptions.Cosine Similarity: The cosine similarity is calculated between all pairs of products. A higher cosine similarity score between two products means they are more alike in content.Recommendation: When a user views a product, the system finds the products with the highest cosine similarity scores to that product and recommends them.Collaborative FilteringFind Similar Users: When a user requests recommendations, the system first identifies other users who have rated the same products highly.Identify Liked Products: It then looks at the other products that these similar users have liked.Recommend: The system recommends the most popular products among the similar users, excluding items the target user has already rated.How to RunSave the files: Make sure you have recommender.py, products.csv, ratings.csv, and app.py in the same directory.Install dependencies: You'll need pandas and scikit-learn. You can install them using pip:pip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the application: Execute the app.py script from your terminal:python app.py
Follow the on-screen prompts: You can choose to view all products, get recommendations for a specific product, or get personalized recommendations based on your user ID.
